# Summary

**A dock for the oneplus 5 phone.**

It has a small sound amplifier (sufficient for me needs).
It's designed for :
 * The official USB 3 cable dimensions so that it fit (the one delivered with the phone). 
 * Phone + official case size (should be fine without the case, less tight in this case).

Glue is not mandatory for the cable but can help to ensure it does not go away when you take the phone. 
Another solution, is to add few adhesive tape rounds on the head of the USB cable so that it fit tightly the hole (that's what I did).

The blender file is attached so that you can  easily remix it (it's made of boolean operations and holes are on layer #3)

In files  you'll also find a version with less tight stand (78.2mm x 8.9mm) if you have a bigger case than mine.

Notes: 
Side notes for those using *Slic3r prusa edition* :

 * I used multi-resolution to refine only upper layers (to 0.05mm) to have a nice finish on the top.

 * On my print I used "combine infill every 2 layers" + "only infill where needed". I'm please with the weight and robustness on the object but you might want to use higher infill.
